## Background

Some simple tools in python for MDU

## Tools

### merge-ngs-lanes

Use it to correctly merge lanes from an Illumina run into the a single FASTQ.

Get help:

```bash
merge-ngs-lanes --help
```

Basic usage:

```bash
merge-ngs-lanes -i /path/to/fastq_folder -o /path/to/output > cmd.sh
```

Advanced usage:

You can split the output to muliple subfolders of the output folder by adding `--subfolder`
to the command line. The option can be used multiple times, and takes two space separated values as input:
`path` `regex`. The `path` gives a name of the subfolder in the output folder, and the `regex` expression
determines which samples go in that subfolder.

For instance, the command below will split samples starting the NTC in to a subfolder called `ntc`,
while all other samples will be added to a subfolder called `data`.

```bash
merge-ngs-lanes -i /path/to/fastq -o /path/to/output --subfolder 'data' '(?!NTC).*' --subfolder 'ntc' '(?<=NTC).*' > cmd.sh
```
